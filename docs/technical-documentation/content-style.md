# Content Style

## Most Importantly

**Be consistent**.
If you are unsure of how to do something, see if there are similar examples in the Field Guide and follow the style used.
Please get in touch if you find inconsistencies or something doesn't make sense.

## Writing Style

- When using pronouns in reference to a hypothetical person, gender neutral pronouns (they/their/them) should be used.
- All documents (other than those for internal use only) must be written clearly and simply so that a student is able to understand them.
- Any jargon used needs to be clearly explained and should be considered as a glossary definition.

## Separators

- Use a hyphen to hyphenate words (e.g. ``double-barrelled words``).
- Use ``&ndash;`` to add supplemental information (e.g. ``do this &ndash; it does something!``).
- ``&ndash;`` does not work for titles, so if needed use a hyphen.

## Capitalisation Rules

- Capitalise every word in a major title, such as a chapter title.
- Capitalise only the first word per sentence in a lesser title, such as a chapter section title or heading (for this purpose a colon or hyphen counts as the end of a sentence).
- Capitalise acronyms/initialisms like *NASA* and *CSFG*.
- Capitalise proper nouns (such as peoples' names) appropriately.
- Do not capitalise general terms or jargon unless the above rules apply.

## Spelling

Since we are based in Aotearoa (New Zealand), our primary language is British English (*colour* instead of *color*).
This guide is for resolving ambiguity for specific words and phrases, to ensure consistency in UCCSER content.

### a | an

Use depending on the inital *sound* made by the following word:

- ``a`` when the following word *sounds* like it starts with a **consonant**. e.g. Do *a* homework task.
- ``an`` when the following word *sounds* like it starts with a **vowel**. e.g. Do *an* honest task.

### camel case | camelcase | camel-case

Use two words:

- ``camel case``

### licence | license

Use the British English standard:

- ``licence`` as a **noun**. e.g. To get a *licence*.
- ``license`` as a **verb**. e.g. To *license* a thing.

### lower case | lowercase | lower-case

Use two words:

- ``lower case``

### upper case | uppercase | upper-case

Use two words:

- ``upper case``
